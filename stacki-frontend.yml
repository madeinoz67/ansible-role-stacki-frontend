# could indent two or four spaces (but not tabs) to start a list so long as you
# are consistent for that logical layer of the data structure.

- hosts:
  # use 'all' here if you're also giving a comma-separated list of domain
  # names as an argument to `ansible-playbook --inventory` or wish to target all
  # hosts in the inventory file
 #- all
  # otherwise, give the name of a host group in the inventory file

  vars:
  # this is always "backend" for now because there were errors when trying to
  # maintain multiple appliances; it seems easier to just declare a new
